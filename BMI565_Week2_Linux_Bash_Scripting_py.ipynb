    "\n",
    "1. Automate repetitive tasks\n",
    "2. Create tailored sequences of commands\n",
    "3. Link together software tools written in different languages \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a bash script is very similar to writing a Python program. A bash script is a text file containing command that are interpreted by the bash interpreter. Just as in Python, the first line should contain a shebang (e.g. `#!/bin/bash`) indicating the location of the interpreter. To run a bash script you have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bash my_script.sh\n",
    "    \n",
    "    chmod 755 my_script.sh\n",
    "    ./my_script.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linux Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment variables hold information about the computer environment in which your programs are running. You can view all environment variables with the `env` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    env\n",
    "    \n",
    "The `PATH` environment variable tells the operating system where to look for executable programs. The `PATH` variable is simply a list of directories. When you attempt to execute a program the operating system will search these directories (in the order listed) for the program you requested. For instance, many of the utilities we've talked about today are located in the `/usr/bin` folder. Because this directory is listed in the `PATH` variable, you won't need to explicitly tell the OS where the utility is located. You can see where a program is located with the `which` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    which paste\n",
    "    \n",
    "    which python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the `PATH` variable as follows (this will add a folder in your home directory to the `PATH`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    PATH=~/bin:$PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "The export command will make the variable available to any subshell (i.e. a shell script).\n",
    "\n",
    "    export PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment variables can also be accessed from within a bash script. Access the variable by placing a `$` before the variable name. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    echo $PATH\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bash Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assign user variables inside bash scripts with the format: `variable=value`. There must be no spaces between the `=` and the variable name or value. Just like above, to access the variable append a `$` to the front of the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    first_name=\"John\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "Use the `echo` or `printf` commands to print output. `printf` accepts format specifiers much like in Python.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    echo $first_name\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Command-line Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "To access command-line arguments within a bash script use the special variables `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc. For example, to supply a file name to script you would run the script as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    bash my_script.sh filename\n",
    "    \n",
    "Within the script `my_script.sh` the `filename` argument might be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    filename=$1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if [ -r $filename ]; then\n",
    "        linecount=$(wc -l $filename)\n",

    "    fi\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exit Status\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs return an exit status to indicate whether the program ran successfully or not (i.e. an error occured). An exit status of 0 indicates the command ran successfully. An exit status other than 0 indicates a failure, with specific codes indicating different errors (exact codes depend on the program). We can use the exit status of commands to make decisions in our scripts. For example, an exit status can be used as a condition in control structures (as seen below). The special variable `$?` holds the exit status of the previous command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    grep -q \"ATCG\" text.txt\n",
