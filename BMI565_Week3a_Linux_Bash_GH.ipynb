    "\n",
    "- Automate repetitive tasks\n",
    "- Create custom sequence of commands\n",
    "- Link together software tools written in different languages\n",
    "\n",
    "How I use it,\n",

    "- **NO** spaces around equals\n",
    "- `\"\"` not required around a string\n",
    "- Save output of commands using `$( )` or ticks `` ` ``\n",
    "- Call using the `$` \n",
    "    - `{}` not always required but good practice\n",
    "    - Are required when expanding array elements (i.e. `${array[42]}`)\n",
